What is header in Postman? 
Headers in a HTTP request or response is the additional information that is transferred to the user or the server. In postman, the headers can be seen in the Headers tab.

Response Entity in Spring Boot:
The ResponseEntity class is used when we one to programmatically specify all aspects of an HTTP response. This includes the headers, body, and, of course, the status code. This way is the most verbose way of returning an HTTP response in Spring Boot but also the most customizable

Status Code in Postman:
A status code defines the status of the request. On entering URL, a mistake can be typed in the URL, or there may be a server-side problem. Status code is used to know about what went wrong and where you made a mistake. There are different status codes, and each of the status codes has different meanings.

Let's see some standard status codes:

200: This code is used for a successful request.
201: For a successful request and data was created.
204: For empty response.
400: This is used for Bad Request. If you enter something wrong or you missed some required parameters, then the request would not be understood by the server, 
and you will get 400 status code.
401: This is used for Unauthorized Access. If the request authentication failed or the user does not have permissions for the requested operations, then you will
get a 401 status code.
403: This is for Forbidden or Access Denied.
404: This will come if the Data Not Found.
405: This will come if the method not allowed or if the requested method is not supported.
500: This code is used for Internal Server Error.
503: And this code is used for Service Unavailable.
